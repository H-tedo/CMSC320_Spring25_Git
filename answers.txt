Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a great tool to learn where we want to collaborate with others in the same environment. It allows for version control to track the changes we make to code over time. It also allows us to revert back to previous versions in the case we need to. You could also create different branches and merge them if needed.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Based on the results, they can optimize the education system to further improve the educational resources. An example would be to see there is data proving chromebooks lead to better test results.
